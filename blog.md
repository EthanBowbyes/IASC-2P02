<h2>Prompt</h2>
Both <b>Moretti</b> and <b>Drucker</b> argue that visual forms (e.g. graphs, maps, etc.) can and should be used to represent cultural phenomena (e.g. the experience of temporality, rises and falls in genre, etc.). Moving between written and visual mediums of expression offers a model for the next generation of digital humanities scholarship, where readers are asked to think critically across both textual and graphical modes. As such, digital humanities scholarship should increasingly create multimodal scholarship where readers interpret both the text and any other media (such as graphs, images, audio, and so on). <b>Creating scholarship that asks readers to interpret across multiple modes will distinguish (treat as different) digital humanities scholarship from scholarship in other fields.</b> 

<h2>Another Digital Humanities Revolution?</h2>
<!-- Intro -->
<p>Scholarly readings can be very difficult to understand, interpret, and absorb, which is many times due to extensive amounts of complex textual context. By increasingly adding multimodal media into digital humanities scholarship, the skill of interpreting multimodal readings will be developed by readers in the scholarship. This would also make the digital humanities scholarship more understandable and appealing, specifically on the reading side of it. When looking at comprehensive readings, the addition of a visual (graph, sound etc.)  element helps the reader grasp the information. Incorporating multimodality also brings the text to life in a way that visualizes exactly what the text is talking about while showing that visualization can be created with any field. Although the readings required in the digital humanities scholarship are being read by university students, they are commonly intimidating. </p>

<p>This can be avoided by adding multimodal components. For example, if a visual learner opens up a purely textual reading, there is automatically a turn off and preconceived discouragement. Although scholarly articles are consumed by higher-level students, the pure text is unacceptable. Having multimodal elements in scholarly articles does not take away any seriousness or credibility. This would indeed make readings more accessible for more than just one type of learner. Auditory and visual learners matter just as much as people who learn through reading. Having said that, all digital humanities publications should have some sort of multimodal aspect to it. This can be achieved by setting a standard to encourage it and ultimately making it mandatory. </p>

<!-- Morretti & Drucker -->
<p>Having multimodal elements not only makes readings more understandable and accessible to readers but can also be used in non-traditional ways, especially when concentrating on graphical modes. In class, “Graphs, Maps, Trees: Abstract Models for Literary History - 1” by Franco Moretti and “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display” by Johanna Drucker were read and analyzed. In these articles both Moretti and Drucker argue that visual forms can and should be used to represent cultural phenomena. Many cultural phenomena are seen as non-graphical because the information is subjective. Digital humanists Moretti and Drucker both use graphs in their articles to represent various non-traditional uses of graphs including monitoring a person's mood versus how many hours have gone by. </p>

<p>Figure one below is an example of how Drucker uses a graph to map out subjective information by representing, “the “appearance” in 1855 of fourteen novels is shown in relation to the time of writing, acquisition, editing, pre-press work, and release, thus showing publication date as a factor of many other processes whose temporal range is very varied” (Drucker, 2011). In Drucker’s article (2011) she says, “Subjective information can use graphical means to show its inflected character, demonstrating its deviation from standard norms in the way the display looks, or, in dynamic displays, the way it acts” (Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display, para. 26). Drucker is stressing that subjective information can also be graphed because it can be understood and seen differently. It can act as something completely new because the capta is shown in a new way to be better understood, as opposed to reading pure text.</p>

<p>In an alternate Drucker article called “Humanistic Theory and Digital Scholarship” (2012), she says, “As we turn our attention from that first phase of textual studies and critical editing, we see the phenomena I noted appear on the horizon: data mining with all its attendant visualization techniques, engagement with geospatial tools, and the use of timelines and other graphic conventions... where predictable outcomes and repeatable results are at the desired outcomes even if they are not absolute tenets of belief”(Humanistic Theory and Digital Scholarship, para. 14).  This quote highlights how digital humanities are evolving and is a continually evolving field of study. </p>

<p>As shown below (figure 2), some of the main words that are mentioned in the two main acknowledged articles by Moretti and Drucker include, “humanistic”, “graphical”, “data”, “information” and “interpretation”. These words are all related and important because it summarizes what they are talking about by visually displaying words used more frequently as larger and vice versa. These words precisely summarize the main points of the readings that were discussed.  </P>

<!-- DM versus Other feilds -->
<p>Asking readers to interpret across multiple modes will distinguish digital humanities scholarship from a scholarship in the sciences because subjective and humanistic capta is being interpreted, rather than just quantitative data. The sciences can even look at the digital humanities and rethink how they think about and use graphs in the context of their scholarship. Moretti says in his article (2003), “Quantitative research provides a type of data which is ideally independent of interpretations, I said earlier, and that is of course also its limit: it provides data, not interpretation” (Graphs, Maps, Trees: Abstract Models for Literary History, p. 72). Graphs in digital humanities scholarship provide interpretation while graphs in science scholarship do not provide interpretation but just data that still has to be interpreted. Since cultural phenomenons can be interpreted individually, this also creates contrast when looking at science scholarships because the data is not objective. </p>
