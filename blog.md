<h2>Prompt</h2>
Both <b>Moretti</b> and <b>Drucker</b> argue that visual forms (e.g. graphs, maps, etc.) can and should be used to represent cultural phenomena (e.g. the experience of temporality, rises and falls in genre, etc.). Moving between written and visual mediums of expression offers a model for the next generation of digital humanities scholarship, where readers are asked to think critically across both textual and graphical modes. As such, digital humanities scholarship should increasingly create multimodal scholarship where readers interpret both the text and any other media (such as graphs, images, audio, and so on). <b>Creating scholarship that asks readers to interpret across multiple modes will distinguish (treat as different) digital humanities scholarship from scholarship in other fields.</b> 

<h2>Another Digital Humanities Revolution?</h2>
<!-- Intro -->
<p>Scholarly readings can be very difficult to understand, interpret, and absorb which is many times due to extensive amounts of complex textual context. By increasingly adding multimodal media into digital humanities scholarship, the skill of interpreting multimodal readings will be developed by readers in the scholarship. This would also make the digital humanities scholarship more understandable and appealing, specifically on the reading side of it. When looking at comprehensive readings, the addition of a visual, graph, sound etc.,  element to help the reader grasp the information. Incorporating multimodality also brings the text to life in a way that visualizes exactly what the text is talking about, while showing that visualization can be created with any field. Although the readings required in the digital humanities scholarship are being read by university students, they are commonly intimidating. </p>

<p>This can be avoided by adding multimodal components. For example, if a visual learner opens up a purely textual reading, there is automatically a turn off and  preconceived discouragement. Although scholarly articles are consumed by higher level students, pure text is unacceptable. Having multimodal elements in scholarly articles does not take away any seriousness or credibility. This would indeed make readings more accessible for more than just type of learner. Auditory and visual learners matter just as much as people who learn through reading. Having said that, all digital humanities publications should have some sort of multimodal aspect to it. This can be achieved by setting a standard in place to encourage it and ultimately making it mandatory. </p>
